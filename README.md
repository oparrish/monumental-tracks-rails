My current blog and podcast is hosted on WordPress.  While likely a good blogging platform, I find
that it is bloated for my needs.  There are also features that I want that WordPress doesn't have:
* Built in HTML5 audio player that supports multiple browsers
	* Automatic conversion of uploaded audio files into formats supported for all browsers
* Support for entering a playlist for each episode that is displayed in the <code>description</code>
element of the RSS feed.

I intend for this project to meet the above and anything else I think of along the way.  It will also 
serve as a way to learn Ruby on Rails.  Which is something I want to do, just for fun.
