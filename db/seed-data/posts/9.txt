Episode 9: Guest DJ Set with Jeff of Rocket Fuel
Another month brings another episode of ska, punk, and rock 'n' roll goodness from Monumental Tracks.  This episode has some great new music from the likes of The Dopamines, Be My Doppelganger, Glory Bound and Boss 501.  As well as some not as new tracks from The Toasters, The Skatalites, and The Planet Smashers.  I've also got a guest DJ set with Jeff of <a href="http://www.rockfuelpodcast.com" target="_blank">Rocket Fuel</a>.  He sent me 3 tracks from the 90's by bands he's featured in his 120 Minutes on SAL column over at Sound As Language.  Since last time, I was able to check out a few hours of Insubordination Fest - I included a couple pictures below.  I had a great time and got to check out some bands that I hadn't heard of before.
