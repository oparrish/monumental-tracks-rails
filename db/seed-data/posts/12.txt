Episode 12: Interview with Mixtapes and Direct Hit!
Thanks for checking out another episode of Monumental Tracks!  This is a special one because it marks the one year anniversary of this little podcast AND because I've got an interview with and new music from Direct Hit! from Wisconsin and Mixtapes from Ohio.  These bands are releasing a split 7" on Kind of Like records and it's available for pre-order now.  Just hit up this link:  <a href="http://kindoflikerecords.storenvy.com/products/33321-mixtapes-direct-hit-split-7">http://kindoflikerecords.storenvy.com/products/33321-mixtapes-direct-hit-split-7</a> The bands each have a new song and cover the other band's song.  It's very cool!  Aside from that, I've got a lot of music that I've been listening to lately that's been putting me in a fall kind of mood.  And of course, since it is just about time for Fest - I had to throw some Suicide machines in there.
