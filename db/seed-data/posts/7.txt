Episode 7: Guest DJ Set with Eric of Can You See the Sunset?
I was fortunate enough to have Eric from Can You See the Sunset? throw down a guest DJ set.  He picked some great songs - as usual.  I think CYSTSFTS was the first "music blog" I started reading and Eric has never led me astray.  Make sure you check him out on Twitter too, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cystsfts">@cystsfts</a>.
