Episode 14: Favorites of 2010
This is my first attempt at any sort of top best of... list.  It was quite daunting.  Do I do best songs?  Best albums?  How do I decide what's best?  So, I basically ended up punting and doing a combo of all those things.  I split this episode into two halves.  The first half is 10 songs in no particular order from 2010 that I thought were pretty great or from albums I thought were pretty great.  The second half is 10 songs, ranked in an order, that as of 12/30/2010 I thought were the best of 2010 or on albums that I thought were the best.  Overall, personally, this was a great year for me and music.  I only had heard music by 4 bands in this list before 2010 (The Slackers, The Hold Steady, Geoff Useless via The Guts, and Bomb the Music Industry).  People talk a lot about the music industry dyeing or being on it's way out but, I think it's testament to quite the opposite when I can find 16 bands making incredible music that I had never heard of before.  The top 2 I saw at Insub Fest this year and that's what pushed me over the edge to thinking they were awesome.  If you get a chance to see The Dopamines or Be My Doppelganger - you must go.  I hope you enjoy this episode.  Whether you agree with the order I put my picks in or not, I don't think there's any denying that this is a great mix of music!  Thanks for checking it out and we'll see ya in 2011!
