Episode 13: Guest DJ Set with Lisa from Kind of Like Records
This episode is a touch later than usual so, I'm sorry about that.  I was so squeezed for time that I almost just phoned it in and played the new Girl Talk album in it's entirety as this episode...that's not true...  As usual, I've got a great episode lined up full of ska, punk, reggae, power pop, etc etc etc and it's completely awesome.  On top of that, I've got Lisa from <a href="http://www.kindoflikerecords.com" target="_blank">Kind of Like Records</a> dropping a guest set.  I hope you enjoy and as always, thanks for checking it out!<strong>Credit Where Credit Is Due:</strong>  "Let It Be" by The Mohawks and all background music was sourced from Third Thursday mixtapes by The Drastics - specifically, No DJs, Volume 2.  They are awesome, full of good music, and should be checked out.
