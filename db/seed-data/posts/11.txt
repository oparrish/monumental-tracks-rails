Episode 11: Interview with The Swellers
Thanks for checking out another episode of Monumental Tracks!  This episode of the podcast features all the ska, punk, and rock 'n' roll that your used to PLUS an interview with The Swellers.  I was fortunate enough to catch up with the guys at their Jaxx Nightclub stop of the All We Have to Offer Is This Tour Tour with Fireworks, Man Overboard, and Transit.  We talk about this tour, life on the road, pro wrestling, and much more.  Full playlist and pictures of The Swellers performance are below.  View all the pictures <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oparrish/sets/72157624903984765/with/5021843523/" target="_blank">here</a>.
