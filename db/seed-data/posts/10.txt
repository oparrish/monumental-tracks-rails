Episode 10: Interview with Corey Poluk of The Valuables
Can't believe I made it to 10 episodes of this podcast!  I've got a great one put together for you with plenty of ska, punk, and rock 'n' roll to get your toes tappin' and the party started.  This episode features new tracks from The Valuables and an interview with Corey Poluk from the band.  The Valuables hail from Vancouver, BC, Canada and play a killer blend of soul, reggae, rocksteady, and ska.  I think you'll definitely dig them.  As always, thanks for tuning in, listening, downloading, and all the support!
