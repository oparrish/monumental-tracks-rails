Episode 18: Direct Hit! - DOMESPLITTER Giveaway
I think this is the quickest I've ever turned around a new episode.  Pretty happy about that.  I am feeling invigorated again thanks to a lot of new music finding it's way to me.  A lot of which is included in this episode.  I've also got a copy of DOMESPLITTER by Direct Hit! to give out courtesy of Kind Of Like Records.  Make sure to listen to the episode to find out how to win.  If you don't win, you can buy a copy from the Kind Of Like Records webstore: <a href="http://kindoflikerecords.storenvy.com">http://kindoflikerecords.storenvy.com</a>
