Episode 8: Interview with Bobby from Captain, We're Sinking
Thanks for checking out another installment of the podcast!  This is a great episode with lots of new punk and ska music!  Not to mention, an interview with Bobby from Captain, We're Sinking.  Captain, We're Sinking is from Scranton, PA and seems to be all over the place lately.  Aside from Captain, We're Sinking this episode has a whole slew of music from PA - The Holy Mess, Glory Bound, Spraynard, Everyone Everywhere, and American Armada all call the Keystone State home.<strong>Credit where credit is due:</strong> Photo used as chapter artwork in the podcast for the second part of the interview was stolen from <a href="http://switchboardsessions.blogspot.com/2010/05/captain-were-sinking.html">The Switchboard Sessions</a> interview with Captain, We're Sinking.  Originally by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bryneyancey/4639161197/">Bryne Yancey</a>.<strong>Correction:</strong> I gave the wrong address for Tiny Engines in the episode.  The correct address is <a href="http://www.tinyengines.net">http://www.tinyengines.net</a>.
