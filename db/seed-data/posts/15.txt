Episode 15: Interview with Monument
Thanks for checking out yet another episode of Monumental Tracks.  I'm really stoked about this episode.  I've got an interview with Monument.  They're local to DC and have a record out now called Goes Canoeing.  It's released digitally (now, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/goes-canoeing/id404057363" target="_blank">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://tinyengines.bandcamp.com/album/goes-canoeing" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>) and on <a href="http://store.tinyengines.net/product/monument-goes-canoeing-12-pre-order-coming-soon" target="_blank">vinyl</a> (very soon) from <a href="http://www.tinyengines.net" target="_blank">Tiny Engines</a>.  You can also pick it up on CD straight from the band.  They're 4 of the nicest guys I've ever met and were gracious enough to take time out of practicing to talk to me.  (Sidenote: I must apologize for the audio quality of the interview.  I brought my mic but forgot to change the input in Audacity and ended up recording the whole thing with my laptop's built-in mic.  No bueno.)  In addition to the interview, I've got all the punk, ska, and rock you've come to expect.  Some stuff from 2010 that I didn't get to until 2011 (Off With Their Heads, Heartsounds, Hold Tight).  Some stuff that I found in my parent's attic that I forgot about (Pollen, Geggy Tah, Dance Hall Crashers.)  And some stuff that's completely new (Dead North, The Haverchucks.)  I hope you enjoy!
